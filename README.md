Blood Cell Identification using Faster R-CNN

Detection of White Blood Cell and Red Blood Cell is very useful for various medical applications, like counting of WBC, disease diagnosis, etc . Manually looking at the sample via a microscope is a tedious process. And this is where Deep Learning models play such a vital role.

They can classify and detect the blood cells from microscopic images with impressive precision.

We will be using Faster R-CNN algorithm for detection of the cells

The application is hosted on AWS EC2 http://13.233.201.126:8501/
